There are some basic pieces of software you will need to develop websites. So the first thing you should do is go download and install the listed programs.

1. **Visual Studio Code** - This is your code editor, the most essential piece of software for coding. There are other editors, both free and paid - but this is the one I will be using for these classes. It is free and the most used editor out there. I think it is great, I love it. [Download VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
2. **Git** - Git is software for version control. Basically it allows you to create a repository to store your code along with changes so you can go back to an earlier version if needed. [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
3. **Node.js** - Node allows you to run javascript code in your terminal. It also allows you to use **NPM** to add packages to your project and run scripts, amongst other things. When you install Node, npm is automatically installed too. [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## Terminal - Shell - Bash - Command Prompt - Powershell

These are all variations of a terminal or command prompt. They all do the same thing, allow you to use your computer without the graphical interface. It is faster, cleaner and more efficient once you get the hang of it.

If you are using Linux then Bash is your version.
If you are using Mac OS then Bash is your version.
If you are using Windows then Command Prompt or Powershell is your version. I am using Powershell 7, I highly recommend using it if you are on a windows machine. You will need to download and install it here: [Powershell Installer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows?view=powershell-7.2#msi)


I will list the different commands, though often they are the same.
