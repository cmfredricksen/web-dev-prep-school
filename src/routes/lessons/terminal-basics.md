The terminal, shell or command prompt is the best tool to become proficient in. You will gain a good understanding of the structure of your files and how to move them, copy them, open them, list them, create them etc.

## Open Your Terminal

You will see something like this:
```
C:\Users\Chris>
```

Basically this is text showing where I am in my computers file system. I am in the Chris folder, which is inside of the Users folder, which is inside of the C: folder.

## Move to a Different Folder

## List the Contents of the Current Folder

## Create a New Folder / Item

## Using Git / NPM
